# web

The JavaScript powered frontend for the Sybl website.

## Requirements

The frontend currently uses the [`Vue.js`](https://vuejs.org/) framework and
uses [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) for dependency management.

## Getting Started

To install the dependencies for the project and serve it locally as a
development build, run the following:
```bash
yarn install
yarn run serve
```
This will display the address that the website can be viewed at.

## Additional Requirements

The frontend works by making requests to the backend, specifically the
`api-server` and thus this should be running at the same time.
